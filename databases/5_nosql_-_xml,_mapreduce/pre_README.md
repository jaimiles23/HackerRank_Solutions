[NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL)
> A NoSQL (originally referring to "non-SQL" or "non-relational")[1] database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

[XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)
> Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable

[Mapreduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce)
> MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating big data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster. A MapReduce program is composed of a map procedure, which performs filtering and sorting (such as sorting students by first name into queues, one queue for each name), and a reduce method, which performs a summary operation (such as counting the number of students in each queue, yielding name frequencies).
