[Relational Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra)
> relational algebra is to provide a theoretical foundation for relational databases, particularly query languages for such databases, chief among which is SQL. Relational databases store tabular data represented as relations. Queries over relational databases often likewise return tabular data represented as relations. The main premise of the relational algebra is to define operators that transform one or more input relations to an output relation.
