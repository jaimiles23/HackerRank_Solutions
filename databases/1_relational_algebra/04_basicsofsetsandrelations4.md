Solution to [Basics of Sets and Relations #4](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/basics-of-sets-and-relational-algebra-4/problem)

The **Cartesian product** of two sets A and B, denoted A Ã— B, is the set of all possible ordered pairs where the elements of A are first and the elements of B are second. 


Set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6} 

Set B = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

Cartesian product = 6 * 7 = 42
