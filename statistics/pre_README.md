# Statistics
Contains solutions to [10 Days of Statistics](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-statistics).

All solutions (excluding multivariate linear regression) are implmeented in Python 3 without using 3rd party statistical libraries. Solutions in .ipynb format include relevant problem notes, formulas, and examples.

_NOTE_: GitHub does not consistently render .ipynb files. This is a well [documented issue](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3555). To workaround this issue, access the github url via [nbviewer.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) in the Solution 2 column.
