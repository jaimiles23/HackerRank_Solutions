# Statistics
Contains solutions to [10 Days of Statistics.](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-statistics).

I implement all solutions in Python 3 without using 3rd party statistical libraries. Solutions in .ipynb format include relevant problem notes, formulas, and examples.

_NOTE_:
- GitHub does not consistently render .ipynb files. This is a well [documented issue](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3555).
- To workaround this issue, access the github url via [nbviewer.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
- TODO:
  - [ ] Change web scraping script to create 2 solution columns for ipynb files: (1) GitHub access, (2) nbviewer access.
