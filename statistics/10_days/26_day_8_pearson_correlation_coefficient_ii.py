	Solution to: Day 8: Pearson Correlation Coefficient II
		https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-7/problem

## original lines
line 1: 3x +4y + 8 = 0
line 2: 4x + 3y + 7 = 0

## Rewritten to regression form:
line 1:
	y = (-3x - 8) / 4
line 2:
	x = (-3y - 7) / 4

## b values
b1 = -3/4
b2 = -3/4

## Know that p = b * x_sd / y_sd from here:
[tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-least-square-regression-line/tutorial)
	p1 = b1 * x_std/y_std
	p2 = b2 * (y_std/x_std)

Thus, 
	p**2 = b1 * b2
		= (-3/4) * (-3/4)
		= 9/16
		= 3/4

However, by definition, the pearson correlation will have the same slope as the line.
Thus, the correct answer is -3/4s
