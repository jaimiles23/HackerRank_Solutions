    "\t## Negative Binomial Experiment\n",
    "\tThe negative binomial experiment has the following properties:\n",
    "\t\t- n, independent trials\n",
    "\t\t- binary outcome:success (s), or failure (f)\n",
    "\t\t- P(s) is the same for every trial\n",
    "\t\t- experiment continues until `x` successes are observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tIf X is the number of experiments until the `x`th success, then X is a discrete random variable called a negative binomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\t## Negative Binomial Distribution\n",
    "\tConsider the following probability mass function\n",
    "\t\tb*(x, n, p) = (n - 1 | x - 1) * p ** x * q ** (n-x)\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThis is a negative binomial with the following properties:\n",
    "\t\t- number of successes to be observed is x\n",
    "\t\t- n, number of trials\n",
    "\t\t- p, p(x) in 1 trial\n",
    "\t\t- q, p( not x) in 1 trial\n",
    "\t\t- b*(x, n, p) is the negative binomial probability, MEANING: the probability of having x - 1 successes after n - 1 trials and \n",
    "\t\thaving x successes after n trials\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\t## Geometric Distribution\n",
    "\tGeometric distribution is the special case of a negative binomial distribution to determine the number of Bernoulli trials required for a success.\n",
    "\tRecall, X is the number of successes in n independent trials, so for each i, 1 <= i <= n\n",
    "\t\tX(i) = 1: if the i-th trial is a success, 0 otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThe geometric distribution is a negative binomial distribution where the number of successes is 1. We express this with the following formula:\n",
    "\tg(n, p) = q ** (n - 1) * p\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\t## Example:\n",
    "\tBob is a high school basketball player. He is a 70% free throw shooter, meaning his probability of making a free throw is 0.70. \n",
    "\tWhat is the probability that Bob makes his first free throw on his fifth shot?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\tFor this experiment, n = 5, p = 0.7 and q = 0.3, So,\n",
